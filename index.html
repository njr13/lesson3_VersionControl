            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control allows a user to recall specific versions of a file or set of files by recording changes to a file or set of files over time. This allows you to revert an entire file or an entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time and see who last modified something that may be the source of error and more. There are a few different types of Version Control Systems (VCS). Local Version Control is a simple version control system in which users copy files into another directory. Centralized VCS have a single server containing all the versioned files and clients that use files from that central place. In a distributed VCS, each client fully mirrors the repository, therefore, if any server dies, any of the client repositories can be copied back to restore it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">For the majority of the Linux kernel’s lifetime, changes to the software were shared as patches and archived files. In 2002, a proprietary DVCS called Bitkeeper was utilized by the Linux kernel to version it. Following the tools free-of-charge status that was removed as a result of the break-down of the relationship between the Linux community and the company that developed Bitkeeper, the Linux community set out to develop their own tool based on the lessons learned through Bitkeeper. Some of the main goals were: speed, simplistic design, support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and capable of handling large projects such as the Linux kernel. Since its release in 2005, Git has matured and evolved to meet and retain these initial goals.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most significant difference between Git and other Version Control Systems is the way in which Git thinks about its data. Most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes and these systems look at the information kept as a set of files and the changes made to said files over time. Git is completely different in that it thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Each time you save, or commit, your project in Git, it essentially takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that picture. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has integrity in that everything in Git is check-summed before being stored and is the referred to by that checksum. This makes it impossible to change contents of any directory or file without Git being aware of it. Generally speaking, Git only adds data in that when you perform any actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. This means that it is hard to make the system do anything that can’t be undone or to make Git erase data in any way. Git has three main states that files can be in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means your files as safely in your local database. Modified means you have altered the filed but have not yet committed it. Stages means that you marked a modified file in its current version to be used in the next commit snapshot.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each time your project reaches a state that you want to record, you must make some changes and commit snapshots of those changes into your repository. Each file in the working directory can be in one of two states: either untracked or tracked. Tracked files are any files that were contained in the last snapshot whether they are unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are anything else which includes any files in your working directory that were not in the last snapshot and are not in your staging area. The initial clone of a repository will cause all your files to be tracked and unmodified as a result of Git just checking them and you haven’t made any edits yet. As you begin editing files, Git views them as modified, because you have made changes to them since the last commit. These files are then staged and you commit all your staged changes and then the cycle repeats itself.</p>
