## Assignment Date:  
February 3, 2017

## Student Name:  
Nickolas Richard

## Project Description:
For this assignment I was asked to create a website showcasing what I had learned in Lesson 3 of this course. Lesson 3 was all about Version Control and within that I learned about Version Control Systems (VCS) and how to use Git.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control - allows a user to recall specific versions of a file or set of files by recording changes to a file or set of files over time.
2. Features of Git: Integrity, three main states (committed, modified, and staged), and it is nearly impossible to remove data from Git
3. Recording changes to the Git repository: files in the working directory can be in one of two states: either untracked or tracked.
